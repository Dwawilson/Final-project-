It has not been that great. I am working on stuff that I think is important. I do not work for assholes anymore--I work for myself. I do not have much trouble getting dates. I am not that worried about money. I do not have a great relationship with my family, but we can talk sometimes. They mostly avoid my texts and calls, because I am pretentious and I do not hold my tongue enough. I do not laugh at their jokes. I do not say stuff you are supposed to say. I only do that kind of thing when I am working. The country stresses me out. I have thought maybe leaving would make things better, but I doubt it. I moved to a new part of my country where things are chill. Now I am just alone with beautiful weather and people who constantly wave and say 'hi' when I am walking down the street. It was nice at first, but I do not have anything in common with these people. They compliment me on being traveled and smart, and it inevitably turns into a one sided conversation. Compliments make me uncomfortable, and I mostly like to talk about ideas--science, politics, business, art, whatever. I am not a narcissist. I would rather be invisible. Buying a big house, having more sex, whatever, I do not think much of it would matter. I do not trust anyone or have access to real intimacy. I have had a lot of manipulation from family, business partners, former friends. I am scared of something I say becoming a news story one day. I am scared of lawsuits from friends. I feel like if I could tap into the naivete and innocence of my youth, it would be good. How though... I think about the reality of the world: guns, lies, cash, fucking hedonism. I cannot tell if I am angry or depressed. I think I am weirdly neither. I cannot describe what I am feeling. I know it is just neurobiology that leads to this kind of shittiness, but I am not going to some doc and pouring out my feelings. I do not trust anyone not to write a fucking book one day.
