I just hate feeling like this, feeling like i cannot trust anyone or that no one would ever truly love me unless i have something to offer. I am always worried about my looks and its just making me depressed. I really do not feel like i fit in with the world I am just here. Idk what my next step should be to get help but I am really going through it. (Yes I am in therapy) but how do i help myself ? I have been depressed/anxious for years and most day i do not even leave my house. But nobody around me seems to care and honestly I am tired of feeling this way. But at the same time i do not want to give up on myself bc i feel like I am here to be somebody great. I am just trying to find my way right now.
