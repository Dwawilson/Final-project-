My friends go out, they celebrate together, their families are proud of them and celebrate with them too. I am celebrating by sitting in my bedroom alone. My dad gave me a hug which was nice and made me feel better for a moment but the knowledge that all of these things I am proud of are pretty much worthless in the end has kind of cemented the idea that it is not really worth being here after all. I do not think my death would really be any different to any of the other unacknowledged milestones in my life. All that any of this endless effort and pushing forward has led to is me sitting here, announcing to a semi-anonymous online forum that I think it is time to give up. What a sad life. I graduated today after five years of education that drove me to the lowest state of my life. No one is interested or cares about this milestone except me. I do not know why I am here.\n",

       "51079    It's getting harder to pretend I'll be okay My birthday was last month. I turned 26. I went to a buffet with my mom because she was the only one who remembered. It was nice, but the whole time I also had this cold dread in my stomach because this is my life, that this is going to be my life forever. And a month out the dread is still here. It's hard to breathe sometimes when I think about how I'm closer to 30 now than to 20, over a quarter of the way through my life by any metric, and I have nothing at all to show for it. I still haven't met basic milestones others do in their teens. And I don't see myself meeting them anytime soon. I never learned how to drive. I've never lived on my own. I've never held a job for longer than a year. I've never had a friend, let alone a romantic attachment. Most of my hometown is a mystery to me because I've never gone anywhere or experienced anything. And at this point, the idea of trying to fix what's wrong is scarier than just rotting away on my own.\\n\\nSorry for the melodrama. Point being, I'm not in a great place right now and it's just getting worse over time. And I can't talk to anyone about it, because I don't know anyone except my mom, and she really doesn't understand why I can't just force it. To be fair, I don't understand either. Thanks for reading, and have a good day.\n",

Despite having anti-psychotic meds and a therapist he only seems to be getting worse. Its only me, my mom, and him. The pressure is literally crushing my mom. He refuses to be open with anyone other than his girlfriend, who has her own shit to deal with. He gets angry when my mom tries to check on him when hes spiraling, almost to the point where I am scared to talk to him. We wake up to him banging on his walls so loud that my room shakes. We ask him what is going on and he either ignores us or says hes fine. His therapists will not talk to us without his permission, which is understandable. We cannot afford for him to see a psychiatrist regularly and not many take his insurance. I feel like all we can do is watch himself worse and idk what to do. How do I help my brother who is struggling with MDD?\n",

I realized I’ve been sending draft emails through to the admissions office and associate prof while I was trying to save them and I genuinely just want to cry and give up. \\n\\nIt’s such a stupid mistake and given the lack of response on the professor’s part I’m thinking this might ruin my chances. I was so proud of my personal statement and had really solid references but now I’m doubting everything about my application and myself.\\n\\nEdit: I received an offer and have chatted to the prof, everything is good now!\n",

I've been trying to find apps to track not just my overall mood but more so symptoms as I'm currently in a mixed episode. Every app I've installed asks you for your overall mood of the day but currently I'm going from 0 to 100 multiple times during the day and also experiencing symptoms of mania and depression at the same time. Does anyone know of any apps that will be good at tracking this?   \n",
      "13755  I have recently looked into reddit and found that this place is actually quite healthy and supportive... I did not know this place really existed... but anyways I have very little motivation to work my way up the employment ladder whether its for a career or min wage job... as I feel so very few careers are really interested in helping people. I am an out of the box thinker and I know most jobs will slice my head if I try quacking about maybe we can serve people first and then profit second...I do not think I have much to say, but I look very young for 26 and it seems that is a turn off for most girls. I initially tried being a psych communications major in college but dropped out as someone in a way handed me a red pill. Since about 6 years ago since that happened, I have been studying different sources on the internet to help me perform at my best if there ever was an opportunity that did not require a degree. But I have little faith and try to make creations and upload maybe assist others in some meaningful way and also make a return. ANYWAYYYSSSSSS I know my story does not sound so bad and I think a big chunk of life is how we perceive things versus how they actually are. I do not have a motivation to get a car or a job because my god mother pays for the rent and allows me free time to make creations, but I do not have a circle of friends that is interested in what I have to share. So I am wondering how I can make money with my stuff without paying for ads or self-promoting. I have asked myself how can I honestly make connections if I do not promote? Some people say offer your work for free and I do offer some stuff for free, but it is quite impersonal type of work and people these days are looking to eat up as much emotion as they can in order to fuel a like or a subscribe reaction. For some reason, I try to stay as impersonal as possible with all my work and it seems to kind of work against me in this type of culture. I am not very attached to specific beliefs or ideas.... so it seems like that is a free ticket for capitalism to rape me.... if this is my destiny.... then what can I do? I have thought about dying voluntarily from malnutrition going out into a rural area and just letting go from there.... but that would be a tough way to go it seems but that could also be a perception. I am not very suicidal to be honest but it comes up. But anyways, I do not really ever share this stuff and I am sorry if it sounds like I am messed up. I am not going to get help if you think I need it. I consider myself kind of an anti-capitalist/materialist but do like small talk and jokes... if anyone of any gender would like to talk and maybe become friends or just talk for a short while without small talk, you would not be ghosted. End: I really do not like how our problems in society are so obvious and yet people play fucking dumb when realizing when someone is having issues... they must be really fucking hurting if they are playing that low... there must be another level of empathy above where I am at if I cannot see that these people are actually hurting inside, but they do a good damn job of putting a smile on their face and saying another day another dollar.

My self-esteem since I was a child has always been bad, I suffered and still suffer bullying because of my appearance and my way of being, and it makes me think that I will never be able to date or at least stay and have sex with someone, after all I am 25 years old and I could not and never have kissed a woman. Whenever I talk to my friends they say that everything has its time, but that time never comes, they also say that I am very demanding in my love choices, but I completely disagree, besides my friends my psychologist says the same thing. I have tried using Tinder and other apps, but I cannot match.I see couples on social networks and I get very sad and thinking: Why is it easier for others?, and this triggers my depression. These events make me depressed, and unwilling to move on. What has helped me are my anti-depressants, which give me strengths to work and do other things. The fact is that I have been so lost, not knowing where I fit in and feeling like the ugliest and weirdest person in the world and that I will never be able to fit in and find a love partner. I need help, ideas, advice or tips to getting out of this looping of sadness. I NEED HELP!   \n",

She was diagnosed back in her late teens, and used to take medication for it. we have both had our ups and downs through the relationship with this issue, but we always work through it. Every once in awhile she will have a manic breakdown, and say things like everyone would be better off if I did not exist or I make everyone is lives miserable. Obviously these claims are not true, and I tell her that. But lately she seems to be doing it more and more. She says she would never hurt herself, but I just think she realizes what emotional damage this does to me. She sees a therapist once a month, and she refuses to take her depression medication. In fact, she has not taken it for the past 6 or 7 years. She used to be a daily weed smoker, but quit cold turkey a year ago.Does anyone have any advice on how I can help her? Or any advice I could give her? Girlfriend says everyone would be better off without her   \n",

Don't undermine my suffering, please.\\n\\n  \\nPeople don't fall in love with someone who's a shell of a person, unable to function and express themselves. They don't become friends with \"people\" like me.  \\nBut without human connection, you are not able to grow up. You are left a forever lonely, lost child in a slowly decaying body.\\n\\n  \\nThere's only so much \"healing\" a person without a support system can do on their own. It's excruciating, and humiliating, constantly feeling like you're worse than everyone around you, a cruel parody on a living creature.   \n",
